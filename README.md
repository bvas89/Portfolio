This primarily contains scripts from my Unity2d mobile project, Save Toasty!.

Save Toasty! is a mobile tapping game that allows the player to use abilities to save Toasty before he is eaten by ants.
This can be looked at in two parts: release challenge and long haul.

I challenged myself to build a new project to release on iOS and Android and was able to do so, part-time, within two months.
I am now going back and incorporating more fleshed-out ideas and techniques. These are the scripts provided.

Highlighted Script(s):
LevelScriptableObject.cs, Spawner.cs

The Level and Spawner scripts work in tandem; Level script contains 5 methods of spawning, some with submethods. The Spawner component reads these values and spawns the Ants accordingly.
