Welcome to Bobby Vasconi's coding portfolio

(as of 8/2/2023)
I am Unity developer and creator of Save Toasty!, a mobile game available on Apple and Android.
Beyond that I have a PC vertical slice, a mobile app (now removed), and a larger solo project in the works. Below is the preferred order to review these projects.

1. Save Toasty!
  Save Toasty! is a mobile tapping game. The functions of the game are simple enough, but I take pride in several of its accomplishments.
    1. Varying Global Difficulty via Firebase - The success rate of all players determines stats for the next day - such as enemy health and spawn rate.
    2. Pheromones - Because the game uses ants as an enemy, they are set to follow other ants that have successfully gathered Crumbs.
    4. I am self-taught and took an idea from inception to release, on mobile nonetheless.
    5. Weighted spawn rates, System/Unity Actions, lambda expressions, delegates, scriptable objects, etc.
  *Please note this was an original learning idea iterated many times over until I decided on the varying global difficulty, which is when I pushed for a release. With this in mind, the scripts provided come from different skill levels and time periods. This showcases my ability to decipher and expand "legacy" code. Save Toasty! is first on the list because it is a complete game.

2. Toasty's Picnic Pack
  TPP is a new solo project with fresh ideas and a greater sense of project management. It will be my spin on a variety pack of skill games such as Snake and Flappy bird. This is the most recent code I've written and will be updated as I continue to build the project. As of now the highlight is a Static GameData script that all pieces refer to, such as the Difficulty Multiplier affecting the speed and cadence of spawned obstacles.

3. Dead Binary
  This was a group project formed over Reddit. My major contribution to this was building a State Machine that handled turn-based combat. I also had my hand in some UI scripts and building Faction classes.

4. DungeonRunner
  This was practice project in the 3D space. It didn't get far because attention was diverted to Dead Binary (and now TPP) but it's highlighted in the video below, so I wanted to mention it here.

5. Unitedex (Not Listed)
  Unitedex was a Pokemon Unite helper app allowing users to click into Pokemon to see attack and item descriptions - which are unavailable to read during battle (circa app release). It was released for mobile but has since been pulled for legal reasons.

Lastly, here is an older video showcasing my projects in real time.
