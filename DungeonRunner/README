DungeonRunner is a project focused more on developing a deeper understanding of videogame architecture, opposed to shooting for a complete project under a deadline. By doing so, I can reference this work for faster prototyping and getting ideas off the ground.

That being said, the game itself is an ActionRPG in which the player may summon up to four AI-driven creatures to fight.

Major Points I am/will/want to incorportate:
1. Deeper understanding of OOP principles. Creatures and Abilities belong to classes, and will have Elemental type advantages.
2. Verbose State Machines.
