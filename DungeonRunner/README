DungeonRunner is a project in which the end goal is less 'making a game' and more 'advancing my knowledge'. The concept is: An ActionRPG where the player summons AI-driven creatures to fight. The game follows roguelike principles but its direction will mostly follow what I hope to accomplish in the next step.

Major Points I am/will/want to incorportate:
1. Deeper understanding of OOP principles.
  . What is the minimum effecient information I can provide?
  . How much derivation is too much derivation?
2. Verbose State Machines.
  . Easy-to-use StateMachine *(Currently : No/Combat states, Ability internal state)
  . SubStates
  . Major States, such as Cutscene/Gameplay/PauseMenu
3. Complex Enemy AI
  . Internal priority system for next attack *
  . Move into range || Use ranged attack
  . Create range of enemies, from simple to boss
4. Procedural Generation
  . Understand the theory and practice behind it
  . Generate a room // Chain of roomss
